<p align='center'>This is the basic menu, it shows the board with the numbers from 1 to 8 in the left and the letters A to H on the bottom. It also shows the pieces but in portuguese-BR language</p><br>
<div align='center'>
- P = Pawn<br>
- T = Rook<br>
- C = Knight<br>
- B = Bishop<br>
- D = Queen<br>
- R = King<br>

<p align='center'>Maybe i put the pieces in the wrong place lol. It also shows the captured pieces, then the black and white, the turn account and waiting for the player X response, and the user have to type where is the piece and where he want to put it.</p>

<p align='center'>When u type a position, this image example is when u type a2 it means u want to move the Pawn localized at the position A2, and it will display: "Destino" it means where u want to go with the pawn, and also make a green line showing the possible move u can do, if u try go to any other place than the green squares show, it will give a error message and u will need to type again wich piece u want and where u want to go with it.</p>

<p align='center'>And in this example it shows u moving the Pawn to the A4 position, where the green squares was pointing and then the board will wait the "black" pieces to play, but the pieces arent black, they are white, well u got it.<br>The game is working nice, every piece have it movement, it shows a message of wich player win and its cool, have fun using this code.</p>
